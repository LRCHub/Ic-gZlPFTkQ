Like a bird thats lost Its mate in flight
I'm alone and oh so blue tonight
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea
May you never be alone like me.
For I believe the lies you told to me
When you whispered dear I worship thee
Now here am I alone and blue
All because i love no one but you.
I gave up my friends I left my home
When you promised to be mine alone
Now your gone our love could never be
May you never be alone like me
In the bible God's own words do say
For every wrong someday you'll pay
I pray the Lord to set me free
May you never be alone like me.
